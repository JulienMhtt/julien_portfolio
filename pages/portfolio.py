                This app will be on the same base as my Filecheck app but more complete made with my latest expereinces in data quality. <br>

                Despite the criticism Excel often receives, it remains the top tool for non-IT services because it is widely used and user-friendly. <br>
                This tool can help these services check their file quality without needing programming skills, <br>

                - **Purpose**:
                This app is designed to help me and others quickly check the quality of CSV or XLSX files we receive. <br>
                Sometimes, when querying a database, we lack visibility; therefore, exporting the result as a CSV and using this tool can help identify inconsistencies. <br>
                Even though Data Engineers do great work, we should always verify the data üòá.

                - **Purpose**: <br>
                This small project was developed to showcase my Power BI skills.

                - **Problem statement**: <br>
                I am working for a large, multi-brand car sales company in the United States. <br>
                The CEO wants a dashboard to monitor the company's overhall performance. <br>
                He also wants to give state CEOs access to the dashboard, allowing them to monitor individual dealerships in their state with greater detail. <br>

                - **Extra info**: <br>
                I aimed for a minimalist approach, removing redundant elements and using color sparingly. <br>
                The dataset is limited to 2014 and 2015, with many states and dealerships lacking sufficient data. <br>
                While additional data like US demographics and income levels could be added, that is not the purpose of this project.
