                    - **How**: I used SQL to retrieve the data and Excel to compile a detailled list of customers.

                    - **Purpose**: Create a report that provied the performance team with meaningful insight, enabling them to better understand their data, make quicker decisions, and reduce repetitive data manipulation in Excel.
                    - **How**: Since all the data was stored in Excel files, I used Python to aggregate historical data and create a clean CSV file. I employed Power Bi to automate the loading of new Excel file added monthly in SharePoint, performed data manipulation, and created a meaningful report. I also used SQL to retrieve additional data for the report.
                    - **Challenge**: The client was uncertain about their needs but required quick results. The Excel files were unclean and inconsistent, making the visialization challenging to create.
                
                <br>

                - **Data quality tool**:
                    - **Purpose**: Develop an easy-to-use tool for the asset management department that helps users check the quality of their CSV and Excel files.
                    - **How**: Building on a personal tool I had already developed, I added quality controls specific to asset management.
                    - **Challenge**: Finding a technical stack that fits the company while adhering to high standards of security and confidentiality.
